            <h3><font size="50">Why should you choose me</font></h3>
            Honestly, in my opinion, I think that this club can surely help an individual in his overall development if he wants to. I really wanted to develop not only my knowledge in technical areas, but also in other areas like public speaking, project presentations, group discussions, and also in learning how to attend interviews. I am ready to work on my talents and passions and I am sure that this club would bring out the best version of me ever possible.</font>

            <h3><font size="50">What is my plan for the next 6 months</font></h3>
            After doing the tasks, I got a lot of ideas about the diversity of the field of computer science. After doing these tasks, I explored the different fields in computer science in order to identify my field of interest.<br> After going through the area of app development, I realized that I have a unique liking towards this field. I am planning to explore the field of App development, quite soon. I am now learning a cross-platform language known as Dart. Using Dart we would be able to develop a cross-platform app(for both Ios and Android) by using Flutter as a platform for development. <br>If I had any doubts or problems regarding this field, I am sure that my mentors would be there to help me and give me valuable suggestions and guidance.</font>

            I will help others if I have any idea or knowledge about their area of work. I would also give my best contribution to all the activities conducted by this club and would do my best to develop the club.</font>
